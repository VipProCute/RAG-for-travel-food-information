You can use the data that we created in folder 'data' or raw the data by yourself. The files: TRAVEL_url.csv, food_url2.csv contains the url to the websites. Files: crawl_content and Crawling_data.ipynb can help you collect data and clean them automatically.

The python files in folder 'Code' should be run by streamlit
